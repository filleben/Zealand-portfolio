            I have always had a passion for sports broadcasting. I started
            calling games over my PlayStation when I was just six years old,
            something of which my mom took notice because she always heard me
            down the hall. At 15, my middle school was looking for someone to MC
            its student-faculty challenge. My mom recommended me for that event
            and I have never looked back. The years that followed have been
            spent gaining the practical experience to back up my passion. I
            worked with Jim Louk at USF as his spotter for football and baseball
            throughout high school while talking my way into the production
            booth at Yankees spring training games, where I ended up calling
            minor league games by my junior year. During high school, my
            journalistic interests expanded as well, taking on opportunities
            that were presented to expand my skillset. I became a lead reporter
            for the BHSN varsity reporter program and a writer for the Tampa Bay
            Times after proving myself in its high school edition.

          <div class="text pt-3">
            For a rigorous collegiate experience, I attended the University of
            Virginia. Despite being offered announcing positions at other
            schools, I wanted to challenge myself to see how I could continue to
            evolve as a broadcaster while engaging in a high-level educational
            program. I started calling field hockey and volleyball for
            "Cavaliers Live" as a freshman and graduated as an on-air
            personality for the ACC Network's coverage of events as significant
            as men's lacrosse and soccer. I also got to travel with the women's
            basketball team to call the Lady Cavaliers for Virginia Sports Radio
            and called select baseball games for that station as well. Another
            huge breakthrough for me was NBC's hiring me as an intern for the
            Rio Olympics in the summer after my second year. I was exposed to
            production in a way I never had been before. Two years later NBC
            brought me back as a production associate for the Pyeonchang games,
            an even more tremendous experience that allowed me to help build
            large online pieces as part of a team while cutting some of my own
            for the digital platforms. With this wealth of experience from a
            very young age, I am excited to see what the future holds. I am
            still calling games for ACC Network including a recent men's
            basketball game, but am actively searching for the next chapter in
            my reporting and sports broadcasting career with the help of United
            Talent Agency.
